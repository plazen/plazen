## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a Plazen vulnerability you can:

- Open a GitHub issue describing the **possible minor** vulnerability
- Contact support ([support@plazen.org](mailto:support@plazen.org), or via the [forum](https://plazen.org/support)) if it's a **major** vulnerability, so that it won't get abused
